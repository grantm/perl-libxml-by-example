Perl XML::LibXML by Example
===========================

The `XML::LibXML <https://metacpan.org/release/XML-LibXML>`_ Perl module is a
wrapper around the `libxml2 <http://www.xmlsoft.org/>`_ parser library which is
written in C.  This tutorial uses example code to introduce the features of
XML::LibXML and the ways in which you can use the module.  The example
scripts and XML documents are available as a :download:`ZIP file download
</_output/perl-libxml-examples.zip>`.
